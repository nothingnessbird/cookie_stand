      <h2>Our Store-y</h2>
      <p>Pat Genericlastname, the inventor of salmon cookies, is an avid fly fisherman. One day, while out on the river casting his line, he realized that his breakfast, just wasn't cutting it. He was <em>hungry</em>. Even though he'd eaten only a few hours before, the cookie he'd had with his coffee hadn't done a lot for Pat's hunger. He looked down at the Chinook Salmon he'd just caught and his stomach growed. Now <span>there</span> was something filling. Something he could eat and count on not being hungry for a while. But Pat didn't want to eat fish for breakfast... Pat liked cookies for breakfast, with his coffee. He was staring at that fish, and thinking about his breakfast cookies, and in that moment the idea for Salmon Cookies was born. Pat set about finding a way to include all of the nutritional benefits and hunger fighting protein of salmon, and put it in a cookie...that doesn't even taste like fish! It's perfect for enjoying with a nice cup of coffee, as a protein and vitamin boost, or even just as a nice midafternoon snack! Give Salmon Cookies a shot, and we guarantee <span>they catch your taste buds hook, line, and sinker!</span></p>
